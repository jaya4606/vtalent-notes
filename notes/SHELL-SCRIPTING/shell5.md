## Untill loop
-----------------------------------------------------------
* the difference between `while` and `untill` is,
  * in while only when the condition is met then first time it is going to run.
  * untill means untill this condition is met you keep on doing it.
  * when we use while only fisrt time it goes for condition,but if we use untill first time it run and untill that condition is not met it going to keep on running it.

* if we have the condition,untill the condition is matched or while the condition is matched we use these untill and while.
