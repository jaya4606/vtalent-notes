	   2. recreate
	   
	   3. blue-green/red-yellow
	   4. canary deployment

Linux:
=====
1. connectivity : telnet and ping
                  difference
           1. telnet --> specific port ( telnet ip port)
		    2. ping -->
2. i have my application deployed into server and i able to access home page but when hit my application url i want to display google.com home page.
  /etc/host
  testing.devops.com www.google.co.in
 
3. i have created a file and by default some permissions getting added to that file? can you explain the logic behind it?
 A ) there umask is functionality availble in linux.
     umask
     0002
	 read-4 write-2 execute-1
	 664 (666 -0002)=
4. slow ness of application.
   1.cpu (top)
   2 memory (free -m or -G)
   3. mountpoint full (df -kh)
   4. application memory utilization (top)
   5. network delay (ping)
   6. backend system failure(timeout or sockettimeout or networkadaptor could not establish or java.sql.exception)
 
5. i am trying to deploy an appliction with port number 9090 but it is failing?
   1. resouce ( cpu and memory or diskspace)
   2. port already utilized by another process
   netstat -anlp |grep port
   
6. mount point full. how can we find which is file is consuming more space.
   du -sh /home/kushal*
   
7. search a string in file?
   grep 
   grep 'bash' filename
8. i want to replace a string in a file?
   1. with editing file ( vi --> :s/oldstring/newstrin/g)
   2. without editing file
      sed -e 's/httpd/nginx/g' deploy.sh
9. i want to see the files in a tar file without extracting it?
   tar -cvf -->create tar file
   tar -xvf --> extract the tar file
   tar -tvf    --> to view the files
   
10. i want to copy from one server to another ? then i want to verify that file is copied properly?
    scp filename user@ip:/path
	scp -r directory user@ip:/path
	
	ssh user@ip
	
	what is the default used in scp and ssh?
    22
11. i have file in that my name is there? i want to see the file content without myname?
   grep  -v 'httpd' deploy.sh
   
12. deploy.sh a b c e --> how many maximum arguments can be passed to shellscript?
    65536 -- integer range
 	
13. shell script deploy.sh a b c e :
   $0 -- script name
   $1 -- argument1 -->a
   $# -->number of arguments passing to script ->4
   $@ --> all arguments passed to script --> a b c e
14. awk or cut
    cat test.csv |cut -d ' ' -f1,5
	cat test.csv |awk -F ' ' '{print$3,$5}'

15. soft link vs hardlink
     ln -s 
	 ln 
16. how to debug the shell script?
    bash -x deploy.sh
	vi deploy.sh
	  sex -x
    #!/bin/bash  -- shebang shell --> which type shell used
17. how to run process as backgroup or daemon process?
   java -jar test.jar &	
   
18. how to establish password less authentication between servers?
    ssh-keygen
19. Cronjobs usage in linux

   5. macvlan
7. what is the docker network interface get created when you install docker?
   docker0
8. default configuration of docker --> docker info
9. how to login docker container?
   docker exec -it <containerid> or <containername> /bin/bash
10.is it possible to create dockerfile from docker image?
   yes possible
11. COPY vs ADD
12. docker rmi or docker image rm

RUN yum install java
RUN yum install nodejs
RUN mkdir -p /app/test

RUN yum install java && yum install nodejs && mkdir -p /app/test

13. how to validate dockerfile or how will you ensure that the dockerfile written is following best practicse?
 There is concept called linting.

Interview Questions
===================
1. K8 daily activities?
   a.pod restart issues
		memory issue ( Reason:       OOMKiled       Exit Code:    137 )
		liveness probe(healthcheck) fail  --> http://localhost:80
   b.Node issues(memory /cpu issue)
   c.pod performance issue( cpu based issue)
   d.Volume size full
   
2. K8 Architecture and its components.
   Controlplane/master -- > apiServer,Etcd,Kube-controller,Kube-schedular
   Worker Nodes --> Kubelet,kube-proxy, Containerd(docker)

3. what is kubelet functionality?
4. Node status is showing as Not-ready?
5. how to check the pod status?
   kubectl get pods
6. how to check which pod is running on which node?
   kubectl get pods -o wide
7. how to identify the pods running in specific node? or how to troubleshoot node performance issue?
   kubectl describe node <nodename>
8. allocate resouces to the container or pod?
   resouces:
	 requests:
	   cpu: 
	   memory
	 limits:
	   cpu
	   memory
9. my requirement is that i need to place my pod in specific server which is having higher performance?
   1. NodeSelector based on labels
   2. Nodename
   3. Node affinity
   
10. i have deployed my application pod and the pod status is showing as pending? reasons?
   a. The cpu and memory is not available in any one of the node which defined in pod resouces 
	 Warning  FailedScheduling  27s   default-scheduler  0/4 nodes are available: 1 Insufficient memory, 
	 1 node(s) had taint {node-role.kubernetes.io/master: }, that the pod didn't tolerate, 
	 2 node(s) had taint {node.kubernetes.io/unreachable: }, that the pod didn't tolerate.
   b. the label used in nodeselector or affinity is not matching with node labels.
      Warning  FailedScheduling  17s   default-scheduler  0/4 nodes are available: 
	  1 node(s) didn't match Pod's node affinity/selector, 
	  1 node(s) had taint {node-role.kubernetes.io/master: }, that the pod didn't tolerate, 
	  2 node(s) had taint {node.kubernetes.io/unreachable: }, that the pod didn't tolerate.
   c. if all workernodes is down.
   d. if the PVC used in the pod definition not found/matching.

11. Difference between RC and RS?

12. What are the k8 resouces get created when we deploy the deployment object?
    1. deployment
	2. Replicaset
	3. Pods

13. What are ways we can deploy application in k8?(deployment types)?

14. reasons for CrashLoopBackOff?
    a. the command defined in container command is not proper .
	
	command:
      - "bin/bash"
      - "-r" //here -r is not a valid. valid command is -c.
      - "sleep 10000"
