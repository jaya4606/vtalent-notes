1. explain about k8 architecture?

2. what is the command used to get the pod status? or how to check pod status?
   kubectl get pods
3. i want to list pods which are not in running status?
   
   kubectl get pods|grep 'Running'  --> list all running pods
   kubectl get pods|grep -v 'Running' --> list all pods except running.
4. how to findout k8 version?
   kubectl get nodes
NAME          STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION
k8-master     Ready    control-plane   4d      v1.24.0
k8-worker-1   Ready    <none>          3d23h   v1.24.0
k8-worker-2   Ready    <none>          3d23h   v1.24.0

5. i got deployment request and i created a pod in the k8 cluster. now i want to see the pod ip address and which node that pod is running?
   kubectl get pods -o wide

6. what are the possible reasons where pod can be in pending status?

    1. if the nodeselector is not matching with node labels.
    2. memory is not enough to place a pod.
    3. cpu is not enough to place a pod.
    4. you have defined nodeslector and the node is available but i was in SchedulingDisabled.
       k8-worker-1   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   <none>          34d   v1.24.0

7. what are the reasons for " CrashLoopBackOff"?
   1. if the pods contains multiple containers and two pods trying to use the same port number.
      ex: nginx and httpd uses same port 80

   2. if you have defined healcheck with liveness probe with url. then that liveness probe fails for multiple times.
  Normal   Killing    7m55s (x3 over 8m55s)   kubelet            Container nginx failed liveness probe, will be restarted
